# Oolio PM — Skills Catalogue

The plugin ships **26 skills**, organised here by where they sit in the product lifecycle,
signal to shipped. The folders under `oolio-pm/skills/` stay flat (that is what the Claude
Code plugin loader expects). This document is the map; the categories are a reading aid, not
a folder structure.

Use it to find the right skill fast, and to see the gaps. In a session, `pm-compass` is the
live version of this page: describe the task and it routes you.

**Statuses.** Every skill carries a lifecycle status per
[references/skill-standard.md](../oolio-pm/references/skill-standard.md): **In progress**
(lives in `skills-in-progress/`, not shipped), **New** (shipped within the last month or so),
**Stable**, or **Archived** (in `_archive/`). Unmarked skills below are Stable; there are no
per-skill version numbers, by design — the plugin versions by commit.

## 0. Start here

- **pm-compass** *(New, July 2026)* — The router: describe the task, get the one skill (or short chain) that fits, and the pipeline picture for newcomers.
- **drive** *(New, July 2026)* — The driver: take a raw, rambling, or voice-dictated request, turn it into a clear execution contract (objective, done-when, constraints), then plan, do, verify, and hand back the finished result rather than advice. The generalist front door for any task that does not yet have a shaped brief; `pm-compass` routes, `drive` executes.

## 1. Intake & Discovery

Turn customer, support, and sales signal into groomed Jira Product Discovery ideas.

- **feedback-to-idea** — Turn raw customer, support, or sales signal into a JPD idea, or attach it to an existing one, de-duped against the backlog.
- **jpd-idea-groomer** — Groom a JPD idea end to end against Oolio's JPD Field Standards (2026+).
- **jpd-title-standard** — Groom JPD idea titles to the Title Standard: max 65 characters, sentence case, capability-led.
- **jpd-loop** — Run the full Virtual Product Council grooming loop over a single JPD idea, end to end.
- **storm-research** — Multi-perspective, citation-verified research briefing (STORM method), delivered as a clean HTML report.
- **signal-radar** *(New, July 2026)* — Synthesise HubSpot, web, and social signal (via Apify) into cited evidence for a JPD idea, or scan the backlog for gaps against real market and customer demand. Syncs findings into the brain.
- **add-insight** *(New, July 2026)* — The evidence-first attach: hand it one useful thing and it finds every backlog idea the evidence genuinely supports and attaches it as native JPD Insights, one idea or several.
- **competitor-watch** *(New, July 2026)* — The standing competitive-intelligence function: per-competitor dossiers in the brain, weekly delta sweeps, review/community deep-dives, campaign and claim-vs-reality mining, and Fact-Impact-Act battlecards.
- **win-loss** *(New, July 2026)* — Mine HubSpot closed-lost and churn data monthly for the real loss drivers, cross-examined against deal metadata; gaps to the backlog, patterns to the dossiers.
- **discovery-wayfinder** *(New, July 2026)* — Chart a discovery theme too big for one session as a Jira map of decision tickets (fog-of-war scoping, HITL/AFK ticket types, one decision per session), adapted from Matt Pocock's Wayfinder.

## 2. Specs & PRDs

Shape an idea into a written spec, then pressure-test it.

- **write-prd** — Write an Oolio PRD from a groomed JPD idea, a brief, or a problem statement, in Oolio's high-level format.
- **grill-my-prd** — Interview you on a Confluence PRD one question at a time, resolve its decision tree, record a versioned grill page, and amend the PRD in place.
- **grill-me** — Relentlessly interview you on any plan, decision, PRD, or design until you reach shared understanding.

## 3. Validation & Councils

Pressure-test a decision against the Virtual Product Council and its expert lenses.

- **convene-vpc** — Convene the full Virtual Product Council to pressure-test a decision, design, requirement, spec, PRD, or piece of research.
- **design-council-review** — Review a design against the Design Council, the panel of expert design and research lenses.
- **operator-council-review** — Test a decision against the Operator Council, the hospitality user personas (the UAT panel).
- **leadership-subcommittee-review** — Test a decision against the Leadership Subcommittee, the executive and commercial lenses.

## 4. Delivery & Steering

Keep Jira clean and build the packs leadership reads.

- **jira-epic-groomer** — Groom or backfill a Jira epic description to Oolio's What / Why / Who standard.
- **jira-epic-titler** — Suggest a stronger epic title using the `[Capability] for [Outcome]` standard.
- **steering-pack** — Build a Steering-ready review pack over a slice of the JPD backlog: per-idea one-liners, field completeness, VPC verdicts and rubric scores.

## 5. GTM

Take a single product launch to market.

- **gtm-handover** — Build the executive GTM handover: the One-Pager and the Supporting Deck. The narrative source for the rest of the suite.
- **gtm-playbooks** — Build the three internal playbooks: Sales, Account Management, and Onboarding.
- **gtm-marketing** — Build the Marketing Pack: launch announcement, social posts, email sequence, sales note, and campaign brief.

## 6. Analysis

Close the loop once it is live.

- **metrics-review** — Run a product metrics review against real data: post-launch validation of a PRD's success metrics, or a recurring weekly or monthly review.

## Planned and in-progress work

The candidates the next iteration draws from; each becomes a CHANGELOG entry when it lands
(or dies quietly if it doesn't earn its place):

- **Grilling engine split** — extract the shared interview loop from `grill-me`/`grill-my-prd`
  into one engine the wrappers invoke, so the interviewing craft improves in one place.
- **setup-oolio** — a one-time per-workspace setup that records Jira project keys, Confluence
  spaces, and labels in one config the other skills consult instead of hardcoding.
- **The operator producers** — daily-brief, email-triage, jpd-keeper and the rest of the
  staged autonomy roadmap live in the operating model
  ([operating-model_v0.1_2026-07-14.md](operating-model_v0.1_2026-07-14.md)) and the vault's
  Skills Catalogue; they ship here as they are built.

## Reference material (not skills)

Skills call on shared reference material that lives outside `skills/`:

- **`personas-library/`** — the *who*: personas, segments, the Virtual Product Council and its sub-panels (Design Council, Operator Council / UAT panel, Leadership Subcommittee).
- **`products/`** — the *what we sell*: one reference file per Oolio product (`_template.md` is the shape).
- **`references/`** — the *how we work*: house style, output formats, cross-cutting standards, `research-os.md` (the operating model the research skills share: brain taxonomy, cadences, source tiers, the routing pipe), and `skill-standard.md` (how skills themselves are written: trigger specs, lifecycle statuses, the no-op test, the guardrail block).

Where new reference types land (team profiles, process docs, Obsidian routing) is being
worked out in a dedicated discovery pass. Until then, add to the closest existing folder and
flag it, rather than creating a new top-level folder.
